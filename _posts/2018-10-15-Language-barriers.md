Straight to the point - due to my neglectance I have fucked over two of my
personal projects at the same time.
Namely, back in 2017 I have set up some ,,issues'' for Hacktoberfest
contributors. Vast majority of contributions was related to translating strings
into different languages.

Guess what, TicTacToe-C has received only these kinds of PRs. Statula was a bit
better, but a year ago I was less competent than I am now (that is not to say
that I'm by any means capable of maintaing OS project, don't get me wrong). 

Surprise, surprise - I have already received six pull requests with
translations. It is shitty situation, because:

- I cannot validate these PRs due to obvious language barriers.
- These kinds of tasks seem to have low engagement point - nowadays I feel like
  "newbie-friendly" task should still require her/him to sweat a bit. Even if
  he/she is not capable, it's fine - we should be able to guide him/her
  through. Translating ten strings is relatively straight-forward and brings
  little to the table.
- Those who actually spent some of their precious time will feel rejected. And
  it's really shitty.

  I have nothing to say but "sorry". Overall, all translations will be
  rejected. Better yet, I will need to think about some kind of resource system
  to maintain this type of content in my projects.


  I'm sorry.

  Best regards,
  Peter
