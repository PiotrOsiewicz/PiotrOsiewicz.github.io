Hey,
Long time no see. Few things have changed since my last post. First and
foremost: I'm soon-to-be Junior Software Engineer. :] I'm gonna stay vague on
that for now, but for all I know I am really proud of this accomplishment. 
I'm now in my sophomore year. Things are looking up. 
Other than that, recently I got pulled into Embedded project.. although I'm not sure if that's my
cup of tea. Additionally I've started using LaTeX - pretty cool, eh?

That's it for now. I guess. See you around. :)
