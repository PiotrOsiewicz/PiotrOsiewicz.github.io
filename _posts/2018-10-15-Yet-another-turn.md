Do you remember Pychelor?
Yes, I'm talking about this little project that never really took off. Guess
what, it did not take off because I talked out of my ass. *again*.

Hopefully it will change. It's time for bLog. That is binary logger.
I hope to release PoC (which - frankly - I have ready) by the end of October.
I already have plans for improvements, however - given that it's the base of my
bachelors - I needed the first version to be rather easily proven with
mathematics.


What is bLog all about? It is a format for log storage. Data is stored in
intermediate language, which is then interpreted to restore final file. It uses
a dictionary to avoid storing long printf strings.

Hopefully this will work,
Peter
