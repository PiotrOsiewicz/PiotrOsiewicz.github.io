Hi,

First and foremost, this is not an April Fool's day post.
For the time being I have no plans to maintain GetOpt++. Its officially an
unwanted child of mine.
I have new *shiny* things to take care of.Â I am looking into creating a Dropbox
connector for C++. Not that I use their service, but hey. It will be fun.
I hope. GetOpt was supposed to be fun, too.

Cheers
Peter
