Hey,
Yes - I did pull out of this embedded project that I mentioned last time.
To be quite frank, my life went south overall - I am no longer actively
maintaining my projects (even though I did not admit it yet) which is a shame.
I need to do that more. Maybe it is due to rather high workload - university is
a pain in the ass. Well, just the mandatory part of it.
I have met a few great people whom I owe a lot. But hey, at some point I have
just lost the flame. All I need now is a bit of ember to rekindle my passion.
:>
I hope I'll be a tad bit more active around here.

See you around,
Peter
